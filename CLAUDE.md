# DevStash

A developer knowledge hub for snippets, commands, prompts, notes, files, images, links and custom types.

## Context Files

Read the following to get the full context of the project:

- @context/project-overview.md
- @context/coding-standards.md
- @context/ai-interaction.md
- @context/current-feature.md

## Commands

- **Dev server**: `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Production server**: `npm run start`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Test**: `npm run test` (single run)
- **Test watch**: `npm run test:watch`

## Neon Database

When using the Neon MCP tools:

- **Project:** `devstash` (ID: `rough-wave-01978094`)
- **Default Branch:** `development` (ID: `br-snowy-wave-ahmwgmj3`)
- **Database:** `neondb`

**IMPORTANT:** Always use the development branch for all database operations. Never run queries against the production branch (`br-flat-butterfly-ah9tlloi`) unless explicitly instructed to do so.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not add Claude to any commit messages

# CLAUDE.md — Context Layer

**READ THIS FIRST before starting any work in this project.**

## Step 1 — Load the context layer

Read these files in order:

1. `~/.claude/projects/devstash/memory/MEMORY.md`
   → Routing index. Tells you which files to read next.

2. `~/.claude/projects/devstash/memory/active-work.md`
   → What other agents are doing RIGHT NOW. Avoid their files.

3. `~/.claude/projects/devstash/memory/projects/devstash.md`
   → Current state of this specific project.

If debugging: check `gotchas.md` before spending time investigating.
If making a tech or architecture decision: check `decisions.md` first.

## Protocol

### On session start

1. Read MEMORY.md (the index)
2. Read active-work.md (coordination)
3. Read `projects/devstash.md`
4. Check gotchas.md if relevant

### During work

- Add your entry to `active-work.md` when you start a task → prefer `update_active_work` MCP tool
- Update `active-work.md` when your status changes → prefer `update_active_work` MCP tool
- Update the project file immediately after meaningful changes → use `write_file` MCP tool
- Add to `gotchas.md` the moment you discover a bug or workaround → prefer `add_gotcha` MCP tool
- Add to `decisions.md` when a significant choice is made → prefer `add_decision` MCP tool
- Search memory before reading files one by one → use `search_files` MCP tool

### On session end

- Remove your entry from `active-work.md` → prefer `remove_from_active_work` MCP tool
- Append a summary to `worklog.md` → prefer `append_worklog` MCP tool
- At session end, update `live-metrics.md` — increment Sessions, update Files Modified
  from your filesTouched count → use `write_file` MCP tool

### MCP tools (preferred over raw Write for all memory operations)

If the `neurostack` MCP server is connected, use its tools instead of writing markdown directly.
Raw `Write` calls are acceptable only when the MCP server is unavailable.

| Operation           | MCP tool                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Read a file         | `read_file`               |
| List all files      | `list_files`              |
| Search across files | `search_files`            |
| Write any file      | `write_file`              |
| Add worklog entry   | `append_worklog`          |
| Claim / update task | `update_active_work`      |
| Release task        | `remove_from_active_work` |
| Log a gotcha        | `add_gotcha`              |
| Log a decision      | `add_decision`            |

See `mcp-server/README.md` for connection instructions and the full session protocol.

### Critical rule

**Write continuously — not just at session end.**
If you crash mid-session, your active-work.md entry stays as a signal to the next agent.
